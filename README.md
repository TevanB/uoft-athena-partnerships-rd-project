## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

There are two parts to this project, a front-end (/client) and a back-end (/server).

To start the front-end please run the command for local development.

```
cd client && npm i && npm run dev
```

To start the back-end please run the command for local development.

```
cd server && npm i && npm run start
```

## Structure

In the client folder we have a Next.js folder structure.

The .next folder has next configurations, the out folder has prod files that are SSR via our server to deployment.

In the src/components folder we have React components organized by folders representing the page they're used in.

In the src/pages folder we have our main pages - note that routing is auto-setup by next based on naming of files/folders in this directory. Basically, sub-folders are sub-directories and files are end-paths, with dynamic paths taken care of by naming convention [project_name] for example.

## Usage

The client build system uses Next.js to streamline and effectively speed up the building process, all while allowing hot-reloading during client (front-end) development.
