# Athena Experiential Learning Application

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
  To imporove on the experiential learning system with University Partnerships, reducing the load on Educators while streamlining the interactions between Students, Partners, and Educators.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

There are two parts to this project, a front-end (/client) and a back-end (/server).

To start the front-end please run the command for local development.

```
cd client && npm i && npm run dev
```

To start the back-end please run the command for local development.

```
cd server && npm i && npm run start
```

Please note that production of this app uses SSR (server-side rendering) - meaning that the front-end's static files are deployed through the server in order to have the same port for front-end and back-end.

This makes us have to re-build every time we change something so unideal for front-end development.

Please change to distinct ports when developing locally and when pushing to prod, change back to common ports.

Note: future contributors can look into the src/setupProxy.js file to get a proxy going to make this change easier.

## Structure

### Tech Stack

This project uses the MERN stack, keeping 100% of the current implementation in JavaScript!

### Folders

In the client folder we have a Next.js folder structure.

The .next folder has next configurations, the out folder has prod files that are SSR via our server to deployment.

In the src/components folder we have React components organized by folders representing the page they're used in.

In the src/pages folder we have our main pages - note that routing is auto-setup by next based on naming of files/folders in this directory. Basically, sub-folders are sub-directories and files are end-paths, with dynamic paths taken care of by naming convention [project_name] for example.

In the src/context folder we have React contexts to control global states across our application.

## Usage

### Build System

The client build system uses Next.js to streamline and effectively speed up the building process, all while allowing hot-reloading during client (front-end) development.

### User Types

We have 4 user types: general, student, partner, educator.

General just means we don't enforce auth to access the dashboard since we wan't users to be able to look at course overviews/projects without logging in.

### Matching Algorithm

One of the highlights of this project is a matching algorithm between teams and projects with currently has an infrastructure and simple implementation in the back-end but should be extended with more data and a UX/UI mockup for displaying matching results.

The infrastructure currently has a series of function calls in a POST back-end route with a structure that's easily extendable to Machine Learning models like Multivariable Regression - but currently takes advantage of a Maximum Bipartite Matching algorithm based on weights.
